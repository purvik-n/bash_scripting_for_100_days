SSH (Secure Shell): A protocol that lets you securely connect to another computer and run commands remotely.
With bash scripting, you can automate tasks on remote servers using ssh and scp.

Examples

1. Simple SSH command
ssh user@192.168.1.10 "uptime"
→ Logs in to the remote server and runs uptime.

2. Copying a file to a server
scp myfile.txt user@192.168.1.10:/home/user/

3. Automated script example
#!/bin/bash
SERVER="user@192.168.1.10"
ssh $SERVER "df -h"

→ Saves typing every time.
