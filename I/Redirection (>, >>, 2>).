echo "Hello World" > greetings.txt
Creates greetings.txt (if it doesn’t exist) and writes "Hello World" inside.

If the file already has content, it overwrites it.

echo "Hello Again" >> greetings.txt
Adds "Hello Again" to the end of greetings.txt without deleting old content.

ls non_existing_file 2> errors.txt
ls will fail (file doesn’t exist) and the error will be written to errors.txt instead of showing on screen.
