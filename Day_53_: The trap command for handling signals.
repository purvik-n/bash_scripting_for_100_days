trap lets you catch signals (like Ctrl+C) and take action instead of stopping.

#!/bin/bash
# Trap Ctrl+C (SIGINT) and ignore it
trap '' SIGINT

echo "This script ignores Ctrl+C but will stop with Ctrl+Z"
echo "Try pressing Ctrl+C or Ctrl+Z"
count=1

while true; do
  echo "Running... $count"
  count=$((count + 1))
  sleep 2
done
